# cps_sat

This is part of a project turned in to the Combinatorial Problem Solving course of the Master in Innovation and Research in Engineering, at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. Obviously, part of the original project is absent from this repository - namely, the part that actually models and solves the problem presented in class.

The remainder is a small but fairly versatile library, serving to model boolean formulae in conjunctive normal form, and solve them by interfacing with (a previously existing installation of) Kissat. Details on the capabilities and implementation of each part of the module can be found in the first part of the project report, available as a pdf in the top level directory.
